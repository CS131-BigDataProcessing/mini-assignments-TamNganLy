1. Identify missing values
	Remove trailing spaces, tab, and new line
2. Rows with missing values
	Remove rows that have missing values. We didn't replace the missing values with NA because using NA will mess up the mean value when handling outliers.
4.How to identify outliers?
	Calculate the median, lower bound, and upper bound using Tukey method
	Replace values that outside of [lower bound, upper bound] by median.
